        heading: 'What is a pixel?',
        body: `The pixel — a portmanteau of "pix" and "element" — is the basic unit of programmable color on a computer display. Every visual element on a screen is comprised of pixels. The screen projects light when creating images, so pixels are the building blocks of digital light.

When creating digital art, we are essentially painting, drawing, sculpting, and <strong>designing the wave samples of the pixel</strong>. The process of digital art is one of manipulating pixels using an interface or code.`,

        body: `"A pixel is a point sample. It exists only at a point. For a color picture, a pixel might actually contain three samples, one for each primary color contributing to the picture at the sampling point. We can still think of this as a point sample of a color. But we cannot think of a pixel as a square — or anything other than a point."

        heading: 'Physical canvas vs digital canvas',
        body: `A physical canvas has a fixed surface texture and dimensions. A digital canvas has a resolution — its quality depends on the number of pixels per inch, the bit depth of each pixel, and whether you're outputting for screen (additive RGB light) or print (subtractive CMYK pigment). Understanding that the digital surface is sampled light, not pigment, changes how you think about value, opacity, and blend modes.`,

        heading: 'Who is Alvy Ray Smith?',
        body: `Alvy Ray Smith is one of the people who turned pixel-based imaging from an expensive research capability into the foundation for painting software, animation, visual effects, and eventually tools like Photoshop.

He worked at several pivotal moments in computer-graphics history: Xerox PARC-era digital paint systems, the New York Institute of Technology computer-graphics lab, Lucasfilm's Computer Division, and Pixar — which he co-founded with Ed Catmull. He was deeply involved in the transition from primitive computer graphics to images that could be painted, layered, animated, composited, and used in filmmaking.

Smith also worked on early high-resolution digital paint systems, including BigPaint3, a 24-bit paint program capable of higher-than-video-resolution imagery. "24-bit" color meant that red, green, and blue values could be stored with enough precision to produce millions of colors — the RGB image model digital artists still use today.`,

        heading: 'The Alpha Channel — Smith\'s most influential contribution',
        body: `RGB tells software what color a pixel is. Smith's alpha channel tells it how opaque or transparent that pixel is. A pixel can be represented as:

(R, G, B, α)

Where R, G, B describe color and α describes coverage or opacity — how much that image element contributes when combined with another.

This is why a figure can have soft hair edges, smoke can fade into the background, a painted cloud can be partially transparent, and a green-screen subject can be cleanly composited into another scene. Smith's 1978 writing on alpha describes the digital matte concept that became the basis for modern compositing.

In Photoshop, alpha is behind much of what artists take for granted: layer masks, transparent PNGs, selections saved as channels, soft-edged erasing, compositing photographs and painted elements, VFX keying and rotoscoping, motion-blur and atmospheric fades, and exporting assets for games, animation, and web design.

Without alpha logic, digital collage would be like cutting paper shapes with hard edges. With alpha, images can behave like light, fog, paint, glass, fabric, smoke, or a soft brushstroke.`,

        heading: 'Why pixels matter for artists',
        body: `A pixel is often called "a tiny square," but that is only a useful simplification. More precisely, a pixel is a sample of visual information — a stored measurement of color and sometimes transparency at a particular location in an image. A raster image is a grid: I(x, y) = [R, G, B, α]. Each location stores values that describe the image there.

Once an image becomes a pixel grid, software can operate on it mathematically. A blur averages neighboring samples. A sharpen filter exaggerates local contrast. Levels remap brightness ranges. Curves remap tonal values. A selection isolates a region. A mask controls where an operation applies. A blend mode combines numerical values from two image layers.

An ordinary layer composite can be simplified as:

C_out = α_f · C_f + (1 − α_f) · C_b

Where C_f is the foreground color, C_b is the background color, α_f is the foreground opacity, and C_out is the blended result. When you lower opacity on a Photoshop layer, paint with a semi-transparent brush, or soften a mask, you are working through variations of this logic.`,
      },
      {
        heading: 'The connection to Photoshop',
        body: `Smith did not invent Photoshop — that was Thomas and John Knoll, developed commercially by Adobe. But Smith's work helped create the technical ecosystem Photoshop depends on: high-color raster painting, editable image regions, transparency logic, digital compositing, channels, anti-aliasing, and the broader premise that pixels are an expressive visual medium.

A useful way to put it: Alvy Ray Smith helped establish the grammar of digital images. Photoshop and later art tools turned that grammar into an accessible studio practice.

The Photoshop canvas is a pixel field. Brushes change pixel values. Masks control alpha. Layers use compositing mathematics. Filters analyze and transform pixel neighborhoods. Channels separate and manipulate image information. The artist is not merely "using effects" — they are directing a structured system of sampled color and transparency.`,
      },
      {
        heading: 'Why this matters for artists learning digital tools',
        body: `Studying pixels helps artists see digital tools as extensions of visual fundamentals rather than mysterious software features:

Drawing → the placement and variation of marks across a grid.
Painting → controlled color, value, and opacity changes.
Composition → the organization of visual information over a frame.
Texture → patterned variation in color, contrast, and scale.
Atmosphere → layered transparency, depth, and color scattering.
Compositing → the visual combination of separate image systems.
3D rendering → the calculation of pixel values from light, materials, geometry, and camera position.

Smith's larger argument is that digital imagery should not be treated as somehow less real or less artistic because it is numerical. Pixels are simply the medium's basic units — much like pigment particles, halftone dots, film grain, weave in a textile, or marks on paper. His work helped make that medium mature enough for artists to work with directly.`,

        heading: 'Frederic C. Billingsley — JPL, 1965',
        body: `The word <em>pixel</em> is now part of everyday digital language. It describes the small picture elements that make up photographs, screens, video, digital paintings, games, and computer-generated images.

According to historian and imaging researcher Richard F. Lyon, the term <em>pixel</em> first appeared in print in two 1965 SPIE papers by Frederic C. Billingsley, an engineer at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

Billingsley worked in JPL's Image Processing Laboratory, where engineers developed systems for processing and analyzing images returned from lunar and planetary missions. His work was connected to the growing challenge of converting visual information into measurable samples that could be transmitted, stored, enhanced, and reconstructed.`,
      },
      {
        heading: 'The First Known Published Uses',
        body: `Lyon identifies Billingsley's two 1965 SPIE papers as the earliest known published uses of the word <em>pixel</em>:

• <em>"Digital Video Processing at JPL"</em>
• <em>"Processing Ranger and Mariner Photography"</em>

The term was used in the context of scientific image processing rather than computer graphics. At the time, engineers needed a concise way to describe small units of sampled visual information within an image.

Today, we often think of a pixel as a tiny colored square on a screen. In image processing, however, a pixel is more accurately understood as a <strong>discrete sample of visual data</strong>. Each pixel can store information such as brightness, color, depth, temperature, or other measurements captured by an imaging system.`,
      },
      {
        heading: 'Where Did the Word Come From?',
        body: `Billingsley did not claim to have invented the word himself.

He later recalled that <em>pixel</em> may have come from engineers working for General Precision's Link Division in Palo Alto, a company that built equipment for JPL. Lyon interviewed former Link engineer Keith E. McFarland, who said that the word was already being used informally by colleagues at the time.

The exact origin of the word remains uncertain. What Lyon was able to document is that Billingsley's 1965 papers are the earliest known printed examples of <em>pixel</em> used in its modern technical sense.`,
      },
      {
        heading: 'Why This Matters for Digital Artists',
        body: `The history of the pixel is also the history of digital image-making.

Before an image can be edited in Photoshop, painted in Procreate, rendered in Blender, composited in After Effects, or displayed on a phone, it must be translated into visual data. Pixels are the basic units that make that translation possible.

They allow an image to be:

• captured by a camera or scanner
• stored as digital information
• edited through color, contrast, masks, layers, and filters
• transmitted across networks
• displayed on screens
• analyzed by software and AI systems

For artists, pixels are not just technical limitations. They are the <strong>material structure of the digital canvas</strong>.`,

        heading: 'A Local Connection',
        body: `JPL's Image Processing Laboratory was located in Pasadena, only a short distance from many of the studios, schools, and creative communities that now use digital tools every day.

That makes the history especially meaningful for Los Angeles-area artists: one of the earliest documented uses of the word <em>pixel</em> emerged from local work on scientific imaging and space exploration.

The same basic idea — breaking an image into small, editable units of information — now supports digital painting, photography, animation, visual effects, game design, graphic design, and AI-assisted image tools.`,

- **Scalar Fields**: Rather than defining a shape explicitly using outline vertices (like a vector outline), a metaball defines a shape using a scalar field of influence. Every object projects a soft, invisible field of density values into the surrounding space.
- **Field Accumulation**: When two objects get close, their soft fields overlap and add their density values together.
- **Thresholding (Iso-contours)**: The final visible shape is defined by a threshold value. Any point in space where the combined density is higher than the threshold becomes solid; anywhere lower becomes empty. In 2D, this threshold boundary is called an **iso-contour**; in 3D, it is an **iso-surface**.

In modern computer graphics, this concept is widely used in **Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)**, and algorithms like **Marching Squares** (2D) or **Marching Cubes** (3D) are used to compute and render the resulting smooth outlines.`,
